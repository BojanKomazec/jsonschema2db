JSON Schema âž£ Database
---

We use [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) pretty extensively at [Better](https://better.com) to store complex data. Unfortunately the data is hard to query from SQL. To facilitate querying, this library converts objects stored in a JSON schema into flat Postgres tables with proper types.

Only Postgres is supported at the moment, although it should be fairly simple to add other databases.
